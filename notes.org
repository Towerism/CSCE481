    computer science), thesis statement
- Can be in conclusion
**** Main results section
- Subsection, paragraph, bulleted list, or a sentence

    every bit of prior work
  - Not to expoerts in all areas - they may not be familiar with simpler
    concepts from other fields
- Some papers (e.g. literature reviews) are for more general, less expert,
  audiences
*** Actual summary
The purpose the lecture s to show us how writing is done in Computer Science. It
explains how to have good organization, grab the reader's attention, and
demonstrate good ethics. Good organization means having sections which are easy
to find, making it clear what the purpose of the paper is, and keeping your
information relevant to your contributions. It is important to grab the reader's
attention in the abstract and in the intro which tends to imply that one targets
the appropriate audience. The professor said it is almost like
marketing. Demonstrating good ethics means adequately providing references to
relevant material and being honest about your results.
** Thoughts
- Even though this is a CS class, the purpose of the class is clearly to prepare
  me for any kind of professional writing throughout my career
- Purpose of the intro is to get them to read the rest of the document:
  something that seems obvious, but many people may forget this when summarizing
  their paper
- Writing an intro is like marketing. What an intersting way to look at
  introductions. I'm taking marketing this semester, so this really struck me as
  interesting. Professer <Name> even said that the abstract seems to be almost
  purely marketing.
- Summarizing main results is not just about keeping surprises to a minimum, but
  also a matter of ethics. You don't want to obscure or omit results that you
  think would detract from your motivation
  - I.e. if you find your thesis statement is false, then you make that clear
- The interesting phrase that professor <name> used when talking about main
  results was 'step forward'. I can use this to remember that writing a main
  results section is about informing the reader what that 'step forward' is.
- I wasn't familiar with a previous work section before this class. I found it
  interesting that the goal of it is to show readers you've done an exhaustive
  search on the matter
*** Aggregated thoughts
Even though this is a CS class, the purpose of the class is clearly to prepare
me for any kind of professional writing throughout my career. Often times when I
write for academics I'm just following a rubric, but this lecture reminded me
what is at the heart of writing: convincing the reader that I have something
important to say, and then say it. The fact that the professor likened writing
introductions and abstracts to marketing really illustrated this for me. 

I also found some ethical aspects of writing intersting: keeping surprises to a
minimum and keeping the main results section to new discoveries. Sometimes when
writing, one may feel like they don't want to spoil the results or one may even
omit certain results altogether. Before this class I wasn't familiar with
previous works sections, but the idea of letting the reader know about other
related works seems to fit into ethics since it allows one to acknowledge other
remarkable people in the field as well as set the context for the paper.
